Hexplore_It-Enviromine-Configs
==============================

These customized configuration files for the Enviromine mod (found at: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293048-enviromine-a-little-bit-of-realism-1-7-10-new#entry27024280)
They are intended for use with the Hexplore_It modpack on the Technic Launcher (modpack is found here: http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/details/hexplore-it.226213)

The intention of customizing these files is to increase integration between enviromine and other mods in the pack, especially mods like Pam's HarvestCraft as well as making some vanilla potions and items more useful for the control of the variables introduced by enviromine.
